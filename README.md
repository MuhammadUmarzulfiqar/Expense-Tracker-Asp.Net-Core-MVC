This is an Expense Tracker App built in ASP.NET Core MVC using SyncFusion components. It demonstrates how to build an enterprise-level application from scratch. Key features include CRUD operations for categories and transactions, grid functionality with paging and sorting, a dashboard with chart elements (such as an Accumulation Chart to display expenses and another chart to track expense fluctuations), and a dockable sidebar menu. The app uses SQL Server as its database.
